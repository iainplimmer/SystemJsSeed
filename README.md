# SystemJsSeed
Seed project to demonstrate the use of SystemJS and JSPM after checking out Angular2 and wondering what all the funky module loaders were all about.

 Seed adapted from http://www.sitepoint.com/modular-javascript-systemjs-jspm
 
 You just need to ensure you have NPM and JSPM installed globally (if that's your thing) then....
 
 'npm install' 
 'jspm install'
